    "1. **Data Preparation:** Begin by collecting and preprocessing your dataset. Ensure that your data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and it is properly formatted for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Ranking/Scoring:** In the filter method, you compute a statistic or a score for each feature independently of the machine learning algorithm you plan to use. This statistic or score measures the relationship between each feature and the target variable (the variable you're trying to predict). Common scoring methods used in the filter method include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Correlation:** This measures the linear relationship between a feature and the target variable. Features with high absolute correlation values are considered more relevant.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Mutual Information:** It quantifies the amount of information one variable (feature) contains about another (target variable). Higher mutual information implies a stronger relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Chi-squared test:** Suitable for categorical target variables, it assesses whether there is a significant association between a feature and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **ANOVA F-statistic:** This is used for continuous features and categorical target variables. It measures whether the means of the feature values differ significantly across different classes of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Information Gain:** Often used in decision tree-based models, it measures the reduction in uncertainty about the target variable when you know the value of a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Variance Threshold:** Filters out features with low variance, assuming that low-variance features carry little information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Selection:** After computing the scores or rankings for each feature, you can select a predefined number of top-ranked features or set a threshold to keep only those features that meet a certain criterion. Alternatively, you can use a combination of scoring methods to decide which features to retain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Model Building:** Once you've selected the relevant features, you can use them to build a machine learning model. The reduced feature set often leads to faster training times, better model interpretability, and sometimes improved model performance."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "1. **Independence Assumption:** The Filter method typically evaluates features independently of each other, meaning it doesn't consider the interactions or dependencies between features. This can lead to suboptimal feature selection if important relationships between features are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ignores Model Performance:** The Filter method selects features based on their statistical properties (e.g., correlation, mutual information) without considering how these features will perform in a specific machine learning model. As a result, it may not select the best subset of features for a given model, and model performance may suffer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fixed Thresholds:** Filter methods often use fixed thresholds to determine feature importance. Choosing the right threshold can be challenging, as it depends on the specific dataset and problem. A suboptimal threshold can lead to either underfitting or overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Doesn't Account for Feature Redundancy:** The Filter method may select multiple highly correlated or redundant features, which doesn't necessarily improve model performance and can increase computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limited to Univariate Analysis:** Most Filter methods analyze each feature in isolation, which means they may miss important feature combinations that contribute to predictive power. Feature interactions are crucial in many machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sensitivity to Data Distribution:** Filter methods can be sensitive to the distribution of data. If the data distribution changes, the importance of features may change as well, leading to instability in feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Disregards Model's Objective:** Filter methods do not take into account the specific objective of the machine learning model (e.g., classification, regression). Features that are important for one type of model may not be as crucial for another, and the Filter method may not capture this nuance.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Feature Ranking vs. Feature Selection:** Filter methods often provide feature rankings rather than selecting a fixed subset of features. Deciding how many top-ranked features to keep can be subjective and may require additional analysis or experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Limited for High-Dimensional Data:** In high-dimensional datasets with many features, Filter methods can become computationally expensive and may struggle to effectively identify the most informative features.\n",

    "1. **Define a Performance Metric:** First, you need to establish a performance metric to evaluate the quality of your predictive model. Common metrics for regression tasks like predicting house prices include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared (R2) score. Choose the metric that aligns with your project's goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Subsets of Features:** The Wrapper method systematically evaluates different subsets of features. You can start with an empty set and gradually add features one by one or begin with the full set of features and progressively remove them. Alternatively, you can use more sophisticated methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or Forward Selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Train and Evaluate Models:** For each subset of features, train a machine learning model using your chosen algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest, etc.). Use a cross-validation technique to ensure robust evaluation. Calculate the performance metric (e.g., MAE, MSE, or R2) for each model on the validation dataset.\n",

    "4. **Feature Subset Selection Criterion:** Decide on a criterion to select the best feature subset. Common approaches include:\n",
    "   - **Forward Selection:** Start with an empty set and iteratively add features that result in the best performance improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Backward Elimination:** Begin with all features and iteratively remove the feature that causes the least performance degradation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE):** Repeatedly fit the model and eliminate the least important feature until you reach the desired number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluate and Choose the Best Subset:** Compare the performance of models with different feature subsets using your chosen performance metric. Typically, you would choose the subset that gives the best performance, although you may consider other factors like model complexity and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test on a Holdout Dataset:** Once you've selected the best feature subset using the Wrapper method, evaluate the model's performance on a separate holdout dataset to assess its generalization capabilities.\n",
